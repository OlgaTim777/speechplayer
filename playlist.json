I love learning! After school, I do my homework. Sometimes I play football with my friends in the park. In the evening, I have dinner with my family. After dinner, I read a book or watch TV. Finally, I go to bed at 9 o'clock. It's a good day!"

I also have lots of great friends. My best friend is Sam. We love playing football and building LEGO together. We often play in the park after school. I also like playing with Chloe and Ben. Chloe is good at art and Ben loves telling jokes! We all have fun together, and I'm lucky to have such a wonderful family and friends. },

My favourite is the lion – they're so strong! At the zoo, I saw monkeys swinging and elephants splashing. They were amazing! I want to be a vet when I grow up so I can help all animals, big and small. I read lots of books about animals and learn new things every day. Animals are the best!"
